# Examples
The easiest way to learn PyCdlib is to see some examples.  Before getting to the examples, we first start out with the PyCdlib theory of operation.

## PyCdlib theory of operation
PyCdlib aims to allow users to manipulate ISOs in arbitrary ways, from creating new ISOs to modifying and writing out existing ISOs.  Along the way, the PyCdlib API is meant to hide many of the details of the above standards, letting users concentrate on the modifications they wish to make.

To start using the PyCdlib API, the user must create a new PyCdlib object.  A PyCdlib object cannot do very much until it is initialized, either by creating a new ISO (using the [new](pycdlib-api.html#PyCdlib-new) method), or by opening an existing ISO (using the [open](pycdlib-api.html#PyCdlib-open) method).  Once a PyCdlib object is initialized, files can be added or removed, directories can be added or removed, the ISO can be made bootable, and various other manipulations of the ISO can happen.  Once the user is happy with the current layout of the ISO, the [write](pycdlib-api.html#PyCdlib-write) method can be called, which will write out the current state of the ISO to a file (or file-like object).

Due to some historical aspects of the ISO standards, making modifications to an existing ISO can involve shuffling around a lot of metadata.  In order to maintain decent performance, PyCdlib takes a "lazy" approach to updating that metadata, and only does the update when it needs the results.  This allows the user to make several modifications and effectively "batch" operations without significantly impacting speed.  The minor downside to this is that the metadata stored in the PyCdlib object is not always consistent, so if the user wants to reach into the object to look at a particular field, it may not always be up-to-date.  PyCdlib offers a [force\_consistency](pycdlib-api.html#PyCdlib-force_consistency) API that immediately updates all metadata for just this reason.

## Example format

We'll start out each example with the entire source code needed to run the example, and then break down the code to show what the individual pieces do.  Note that in most cases, error handling is elided for brevity, though it probably shouldn't be in real code.
